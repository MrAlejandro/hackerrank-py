The median of a dataset of integers is the midpoint value of the dataset for which
an equal number of integers are less than and greater than the value. To
find the median, you must first sort your dataset of integers in non-decreasing order, then:

* if your dataset contains an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element of the sorted sample. In the sorted dataset {1,2,3}, 2 is the median.
* If your dataset contains an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sorted sample. In the sorted dataset {1,2,3,4} , (2 + 3) / 2 is the median.
